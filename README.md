# Raise Quotation (Next.js Wrapper)

This project was converted from a static HTML/CSS/JS quotation generator into a Next.js project
so platforms like Orchids can detect and accept it.

## Run locally
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The original static site is served from:
- `public/site/index.html`

The Next.js home page embeds it via an iframe at `/`.
